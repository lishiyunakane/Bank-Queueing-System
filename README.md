# Bank-Queueing-System
This system streamlines queue management across three bank branches, encompassing client, staff, and control center perspectives. Clients can take a number (in-person or mobile), staff can manage queues effectively, and the control center maintains an overall operational view, with the ability to pause or resume the queueing process.
